%p Welcome.
%p You are being asked to take part in a research project conducted by Tor Wager, PhD, a faculty member in the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, 345 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309-0345.  Dr. Tor Wager can be reached at 303-492‐7487.
%p This study is on charitable donation.  Taking part in this study is completely voluntary.  You do not have to participate if you don't want to.  You may also leave the study at any time.  You will be paid for every task you completed.
%p In this study, you will be asked to view pictures and descriptions of people being helped by a charity.  Since these people are being helped by a charity, some of their life stories may be upsetting.  Please be aware of this risk before continuing.
%p You will be asked to answer questions about how you perceive these people and what effect viewing the images and reading their narratives has on you.  You will also have the opportunity to make a voluntary donation from your participation earnings to the charity helping the person.  Participating should take about an hour.  After rating all these people, you will be asked to complete a personality questionnaire.
%p There will be no benefit to you other than helping us better understand charitable donation.  There are no direct costs to you for participation in this study.  You will be paid $1 for participating.  In addition to that payment, you will be given an endowment of $1 from which you may make voluntary donations.  Whatever part of that endowment you choose not to donate will be paid to you, and whatever part of that endowment you do choose to donate will be actually donated as you specified.  Approximately 1500 participants will be invited to participate in this research study.
%p At the end of this experiment, you will be given a special code.  When you enter this code on the MTurk HIT page you will be paid the $1 for participation.  In addition, whatever part of the X endowment you chose not to donate will be paid to you as a bonus within a few days of submitting the HIT, and whatever part of the $1 endowment that you chose to donate will be actually donated as you specified.  Please note that donation is voluntary and will be explained in greater detail later in the experiment.
%p Funding for this study is being provided by the John Templeton Foundation for Positive Neuroscience.
%p You have the right to withdraw your consent or stop participating at any time. You have the right to refuse to answer any question(s) or refuse to participate in any procedure for any reason. Refusing to participate in this study will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled
%p All data collected is completely anonymous.  The research team will only see your answers. They will not have access to your name, IP address, or any identifying information.
