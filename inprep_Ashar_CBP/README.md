This repo contains the paradigms used in the Psych. Txs for CBP study (aka OLP4CBP). The paradigms are written in MATLAB. They require 1) PsychToolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/), and 2) installation of the finger pressure device and back bladder pressure device, for the tasks that uses those devices.

`run_mri_tasks.m` runs the MRI tasks in order, and `run_EEG_tasks.m` runs the tasks from the EEG session in order. For both of those files, edit the subject number and the session (i.e., timepoint / day) at the top, and then run the following cells. Paths will need to be edited to match the location to which you download this repository.
