# Paradigms_Public
Publicly available canlab experimental paradigms

Each folder in this repository contains a link to programmed experiment files (paradigms) and stimuli associated with a CANlab study. They are distributed under the GNU Public License 3.0.  You are free to copy these paradigms and use or modify them for your own non-commercial purposes, though there is no guarantee that they will be suitable for any particular purpose. In some cases, some of the stimuli needed to run the paradigm may not be included, if they are not shareable due to copyright issues.  (e.g., this is the case with IAPS pictures.)

Participants listened to the biographies, inhaled placebo oxy or did a meditation or did nothing, answered an attentional check question, and then rated PANAS brief form.
