During each meditation, usually roughly in the middle of the meditation, participants were asked to open their eyes and look and listen to the brief narrative depicting a suffering person. For this reason, each meditation is divided into two parts -- the audio file played before and after the narrative. The narratives are provided in the folder Audio.Biographies and video_stimuli (these folders have the same content, just in different audio vs. video file format)

The word documents contain the scripts.
